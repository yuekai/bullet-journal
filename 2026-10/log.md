**Tasks:**

## Thu, Oct 1, 2026

- [**Online p-value publication game**](online-p-value-publication-game.md) (`Claude-session: de1b2c20-8451-4307-a3d5-b50525cbdd03`)
- [**Strategic z-value publication game**](strategic-z-value-publication-game.md) (`Claude-session: de1b2c20-8451-4307-a3d5-b50525cbdd03`)
- [x] **Set up bullet journaling on m2 and spark** (`~/bullet-journal` @ `89e6e23`)
  Agents on the Linux machines m2 and spark couldn't log their work: the journal wasn't cloned there, pixi.toml only supported osx-arm64 so the pixi-backed git hooks failed, and their global agent instructions never mentioned the journal. Both machines now have the journal cloned over SSH, with `log-task` and `log-conversation` linked for Claude Code, Codex, DSH and Kimi Code. Each harness's global CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md there now has this Mac's Bullet Journal section, and the workspace also supports linux-64 and linux-aarch64.
- [x] **Sync global agent instructions to m2 and spark**
  The remotes' global CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md files had drifted from this Mac's: an older commit-memory scheme (spark's Codex still used `Memory:` trailers), different pixi rules, and no memory section in m2's CLAUDE.md. All four harnesses' files on both machines now match the local copies. The Mac-only Kimi desktop app section was dropped, since its paths don't exist on Linux.
- [x] **Export repoprover rollouts for SFT on m2** (`~/statlib/repoprover`)
  The Sep 1 SFT export merged separate start..done segments (e.g. reviewer revisions) and pre/post-compaction dialogs into conversations the model never saw, and it validated against the shrd/ gate instead of `~/data-engineering/SFT/process_entry.py`. The untracked exporter on m2 now emits one entry per rollout, keeps only status `done`, and gates with that file's defaults. Result: 14,332 rollouts, 492.7M tokens (avg 34.4k), 1,421 rejected to `rollouts.rejects.jsonl`.
  - The trajectories are in `~/shrd/statlib/rollouts.jsonl`. Rejects, per-run parts and the export summary stay in `~/statlib/`.
  - Spark's pilot runs and m2's `20260825-085031` contribute nothing: they predate reasoning capture, and the default gate requires think.
  - Re-gating a 500-record sample passed with no errors, and no rollout ids are duplicated.
- [x] **Refresh Danus SFT export on m2** (`~/Danus`)
  The Sep 2 trajectory export missed the last week of linalg runs and all of solveall, and it had been gated against the shrd/ copy of the validator. The existing exporter and validator scripts were re-run unchanged over all runtime/kimi-home sessions and gated with `~/data-engineering/SFT/process_entry.py`. Result: 33,174 of 33,776 trajectories kept (98.2%), 3.91B tokens, averaging 117.8k (median 92.4k). The earlier run kept 20,006 trajectories and 2.40B tokens.
  - The trajectories are in `~/shrd/Danus/runtime/exports/sft_trajectories.jsonl` on m2. Candidates, failures and `export_report.md` sit beside it, and the Sep 2 files are archived in `2026-09-02/` there.
  - Drops are model-side violations such as string-encoded array args, invented args and repetition loops, so they stay dropped. The orchestrator's own operator sessions in `~/.kimi-code` stay out of scope.
- [x] **Export all Rethlas Kimi trajectories on m2** (`~/Rethlas`)
  The Aug 20 Rethlas export covered solveall only, was gated against the shrd/ validator copy, and discarded the validator's token counts. The untracked exporter now keeps the validated entries with their counts, and it was re-run over every linalg and solveall Kimi archive, gated with `~/data-engineering/SFT/process_entry.py`. Result: 314 of 331 trajectories kept, 38.6M tokens, averaging 122.9k (median 98.7k). The Aug 20 run kept 313.
  - Codex runs (2,318 gpt-5.6 sessions) are excluded: their reasoning is encrypted, so none can pass the gate's think requirement. The 3 linalg Kimi archives hold no completed assistant turn, so linalg contributes nothing.
  - Outputs, rejects and `export_report.md` are in `~/shrd/Rethlas/exports/` on m2. The Aug 20 files are archived in `2026-08-20/` there.
- **LeanMarathon ErdosGraham run artifacts on m2** (`Claude-session: 707489e6-0609-4211-903c-7958b3ba46fd`)
  The only LeanMarathon run (Jul 1–2) is on m2, with nothing on spark. The checkout is `~/shrd/LeanProofs/LeanMarathon`; per-target state is in its `.orchestrator-repos/UMich-FATML/ErdosGraham/`.
  - Logs: `.orchestrator-runs/` (audit/result JSON, 76 job logs)
  - Trajectories: `.codex-session-home/<job>/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl` (76 Codex rollouts, 44 MB)
  - Unfinished: stage 2 stopped in round 9 when its Refiner's PR #75 didn't merge; 34 nodes merged, 14 `sorry`s left in `Main.lean`
- [**Scientific skills database access costs**](scientific-skills-database-access-costs.md) (`Claude-session: 38c27805-0f74-49ad-b513-674f7466a5dc`)
